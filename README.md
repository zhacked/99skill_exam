## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

## Set Up 
npm install <br>
composer install <br>
php artisan passport:install <br>
php artisan key:generate 

## To Migrate database
php artisan migrate 


## To Seed some data
php artisan db:seed UserSeeder

## To run
php artisan serve

## To Watch/dev
npm run dev
npm run watch
